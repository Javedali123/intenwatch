        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Intenwatch (International Energy Watch) is a system that uses the Raspberry Pi and is designed specifically to assist in the clear and easy understanding of the use and consumption of energy.

          The Intenwatch system is designed to securely analyse your electricity consumption in near Real Time in an efficient and economical way, providing you with a clear accurate understanding what your electricity consumption is. It can be used for the analysis of installations up to and above 1,500Amps 400v and will show you in any currency, what the electricity you are using is costing you, the data can then be either saved or viewed on both your PC's, Pi's, Mobile Phones, iPads or any other internet enabled devices.

          All national and local government bodies and large commercial organizations are now aware what their Carbon Footprint is and that they have an obligation where possible to reduce it. Intenwatch will assist organizations to gather the information required, for them to meet their requirement on Carbon Emissions (KgCO2e). It will empower them to monitor and record in a non electro technical format their use of electricity.

          One of the most difficult problems organizations face is how to show both management and staff, at all levels that they have a shared responsibility where possible to reduce electricity consumption. This makes commonsense, not only to minimize running costs but to also assist in the global reduction of Greenhouse Gases and Carbon Emissions (KgCO2e).
